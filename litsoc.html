                irrelevant
                and/or boring, there are plenty of poems that have sunk deep into our collective consciousness as
                cultural
                icons. (What makes a poem iconic? For our purposes here, it’s primarily a matter of cultural ubiquity,
                though
                unimpeachable excellence helps any case.) So for those of you who were not present for our epic office
                argument, I have listed some of them here.

                NB that I limited myself to one poem per poet—which means that the impetus for this list actually gets
                bumped
                for the widely quoted (and misunderstood) “The Road Not Taken,” but so it goes. I also excluded
                book-length
                poems, because they’re really a different form. Finally, despite the headline, I’m sure there are many,
                many
                iconic poems out there that I’ve missed—so feel free to extend this list in the comments. But for now,
