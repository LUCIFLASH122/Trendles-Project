                  everywhere,

                  The salty fluid gushes through those misty brown crevices everytime I confront myself or dare.

                  Those days of live , life and laughter I try to catch ,

                  Running after it ,I either stumble or die due to a disheartening tear oozing scratch.

                  No mistake , no evil do,

                The streets of Lahore feel almost like home,
                a home we left behind
                the mansion that belonged to us
                still stands.

                (
                i never lived in it
                yet
                i miss my home.
                )

                can i even call it home?
                barbed wires seal my lips

                what would it had been like
                if we never left
                if it never happened


                now i sit
                tracing millions of
                footsteps down the ravi


                here lies
                starved souls of men
                looking for shelters in land unknown
                only to find it
                six feet under

                the survivors scattered across
                tents
                heavy with sorrow and grief
                loudspeakers call for ration
                in the lines
                are the poor
                and the royalty,
                desperation
                dissolving lines of class.

                now we find
                walls of concrete colonies
                we are supposed to call home

                //
                i live in it
                yet i can not call it
                my home

              <p class="full-text">"The Days Past

                The days when we wanted to change things,
                The days were we sought to reflect our vision.
                The time when our strengths were united,
                The time where the remnants of our true life lived.
                Alas! have we lost it all
                In the shallow trenches of solitude?
                Riding on void waves,
                In an abyss of nothingness.
                The time maybe be short
                The bitter winds becoming taut
                But this saying I bought,
                Don't let this message be untaught
                ""Dont let the spirit weaken in vainly ego——
                We are same, no better than the other
                The only way we move, is ifwe move together
                Let go your pride and live as one not the other'.

                  The sound of breaking glass shatters me out of my reverie. I drop
                  the sandwich, the plate bouncing against the floor. The taste of
                  sweet tea turns sour in my mouth. His foul breath blows against
                  my face, the slurred words, the rough shoves. Bruises bloom
                  purple. I look down at my arm, track marks not quite faded, lines I
                  wish were older, and a ring I have yet to take off. A roadmap of poor
                  choices, for fleeting moments of ecstasy. I feel a phantom touch on
                  my palm, soft blond hair, bright blue eyes. Eyes not dim, bruises
                  not bloomed. I protect her mind and body; she protects my soul. I
                  clutch at the memory as I see his approaching form. His voice is
                  getting louder. I step back. I hold tight to my consciousness. My
                  hands are hidden. It's dark. Light from the flickering bulbs glints on
                  the knife's edge as I sink it into his chest. He chokes on his blood,
                  eyes going wide. As he wilts, I see her in my mind's eye. The pills
                  are working now. My vision's blurry, yet it has never been clearer. I
                  see her angelic form. The light leaves his eyes as she runs towards
                  me. We float above, forever alone.<br>

                  My mother is gracious; healing smile and tender hands. Her skin was soft and
                  smooth before she had me. With the memory of every injustice she's been
                  handed, sinking deeper beneath her cracked skin, betrayal aches in her bones. I
                  never sleep well; I fear she gently settles on my bed every night, hovering over
                  me with a knife against my throat. No drink of water nor bite of food will go past
                  my mouth without the look of desperation in my eyes, ""Please, please have not
                  poisoned this."" By Cod do I know how strong women are. If I were my mother, I
                  would want to kill my child, too. It is with every one of my careless errors that
                  she realizes time and time again, ""I do not deserve this."" Raised with the promise
                  of love, every hand on her must feel like claws prying a fresh wound. Every word
                  must sound like a corkscrew twirling into her neck. For a woman with enough
                  pent-up rage and horror in her to burn the world to ashes, it is fair for her to
                  tighten her hands around my throat with each disintegrating thought.
                  ""You are a curse to this house.""
                  ""I know, ma.""
                  As afraid as I am that you will finally cross the line, stain your cooking knife with
                  my blood; receiving a well-deserved catharsis, you never will. After every time
                  you tell me I'm why
                  you'll never be happy, you fold my clothes for me. For every bruise you leave on
                  my body, you make my favourite dinner. Though you'll never say it, your eyes
                  always search for
                  forgiveness in mine.<br>
                  ""It's okay ma, you just don't know who else to blame.""<br>

                  Icarus died because he flew too close to the sun. People consider it as a
                  tragedy, but I would say it was mercy. What if he was still falling from
                  the sky, suspended in a place between life and death experiencing the
                  fear, the agony, the pain repeatedly? In anticipation of what'll come
                  next, he would still be waiting for an inevitable fate that doesn't arrive.
                  But there is another question that arises. What if he had survived? What
                  would have become of him then? Would he have gone mad or would
                  this have been a key for him to transcend to another level? We can only
                  form conjectures. The possibilities of what could have been are infinite.
                  With these thoughts on my mind on the way to my house I saw
                  something. A stroller, with a baby, rolling down the road about to crash.
                  With supernatural reflexes I had no prior idea about I managed to pull
                  the baby out of the stroller. The moment I saw the baby I was holding,
                  something happened. A butterfly fluttered its wing, the first domino
                  fell, the first reaction started. Then it looked at me, the ripple started,
                  the second domino dropped, the chain continued. Then he smiled. The
                  ripple turned into tsunami, dominoes fell in heap, the chain progressed
                  exponentially. I was reduced to an entangled mess of feelings. He was a
                  strange creature. Moments ago, facing death and now, smiling. His
                  mother came to thank me but I was in a daze. The feeling of his touch
                  still imprinted on me and my soul. Maybe something major shifted
                  inside the universe in that small tiny moment because it seemed
                  different somehow. A smile, probably first in a long time, creeped
                  across my face. And then I continued my walk home.<br>

                  I don't even remember the first time I saw her. Maybe it wasn't that important for
                  me back then. Yeah, she was like that. She would disappear in front of you and you
                  won't even notice. They said she was a loner ; a freak. She was tagged a 'loser'.
                  Losers are those who lack courage; but little did they know that she was the bravest
                  soul among us all.
                  What she really needed was a helping hand, someone she could rely on in her lows:
                  a friend. Was it so difficult to make a friend?
                  I remember the day she slipped and fell face-first on the corridor floor. I was right
                  there. She looked around, as if hoping someone would help her and her eyes met
                  mine. It felt as though she knew I would help, I really wanted to. Yet, I stood there
                  like a stone. Afraid that my friends would call me a freak too. She was laughed at.
                  Tears streamed down her beautiful face.
                  Every time our eyes met, they beseeched me. One warm hug, a mouthful of words
                  would suffice to soothe her. But I did nothing.
                  Today, I heard she attempted suicide.
                  My heart sank Tears came out as if they wanted to punish me.
                  Was my ego more important than her life?
                  Disgust rose deep inside me. What had I done? How did I become this pathetic?
                  Was it really her who deserved to die?
                  I could have killed myself that day and felt nothing.
                  You never know what someone is going through. Even a few words can make a
                  difference.<br>

                  I never forget a face! This is the claim I Often make, priding my ability to recognize
                  people I've encountered. However, names and circumstances evade my memory, a
                  fact that recently led me into an unforeseen predicament.
                  Just the other day, I found myself at a cafe, eagerly awaiting a childhood friend I
                  hadn't seen in 15 years. As I waited, my eyes were drawn to a pale, thin man by the
                  corner. His face looked strangely familiar, triggering a growing suspicion, could this
                  be my long-lost buddy?
                  Driven by curiosity, I approached and sat across from him, initiating a
                  conversation. The man mostly listened as I spoke, wearing a warm smile on his oval
                  face, reminiscent of the person I remembered from all those years ago. He
                  mentioned losing his job and seeking new employment, but divulged nothing about
                  his family or residence. I brushed it off, assuming his shyness around relatively less
                  familiar faces persisted. He hadn't changed a bit.
                  As we prepared to leave, rain suddenly poured down. He hesitantly asked if I could
                  drop him by the junction, to which I playfully teased him and agreed to give him a
                  lift. We had merely reached the junction when he asked me to take a turn at the by-
                  road. He simply got down in the rain and I too got down to bring him back. I was
                  attacked and the next thing I realise was that my car and purse were gone. I was left
                  in a state of shock, realizing I had fallen victim to a clever impostor.
                  The following day, I mustered the courage to visit the police station and report the
                  incident. In the midst of the commotion, that a particular poster caught my eye:
                  ""Wanted,"" it read. To my dismay, the face staring back at me was none other than
                  the imposter who had cunningly deceived me!<br>

                  Once there was a person with no name, he used to travel every land to make a name for
                  himself, wait... He was travelling to find a name for himself. He stumbled upon a place
                  known as What.
                  He found a lot of people like him with no name.
                  After watching them he thought that it would be okay even if he doesn't have a name. So
                  he stopped trying to find a name for himself. After a while he was finding something
                  unusual within him. A Demon? NO it was himself. He is a weird guy so people around the
                  place What treated him as an outcast, He realized it himself and started a journey again to
                  find a name for him, He used to mutter words like Why?, Weird!, Yes people are weird.
                  Without knowing what was happening he found himself in a loop where he can't escape
                  the loop for some months.
                  The guardian of the loop used to ask him some questions :-
                  You look tired, but you haven't even do anything.
                  Do you have any aim to do in your life?
                  What are goals ofa person defined by?
                  How do humans define happiness?
                  He again muttered some words like Yes the guardian is weird. Ignoring
                  the questions asked by the guardian.
                  After some months he broke the loop, now all that left for him is emptiness, he doesn't
                  know what to do! Ile got lost in his way. Ahh we can't say that he got lost since he doesn't
                  have a destination to arrive. He got thirsty and went by a lake to drink some water, after
                  seeing the reflection(No reflection of him), he realized that he is a imagination Of someone
                  else.
                  He never had a name.<br>

        found in the manga that sculpt our hearts diving into our humanity making the world a better place to live. The
        Manga Club is a world where each panel is an entire universe unto itself, every single one of them.</p>

      <p class="hh">Quizzing & Debating</p>
      <p class="con">Our mind is a sculptor, chiseling away the marble to reveal the stunning masterpiece of knowledge
        and eloquence within us. Quizzing is not just about intelligence, it is like a key, carefully unlocking the
        simplest of puzzles, transforming everyday facts into treasures of insight. Debate, on the other hand, is a
        symphony where confidence is the conductor, orchestrating a melody of words that resonate with power and
        precision. It’s not just what we say, but how we say it – each argument is a brushstroke on the canvas of war.
        Together, quizzing and debating are the forge and flame, crafting minds as resilient and radiant as the sun.</p>
